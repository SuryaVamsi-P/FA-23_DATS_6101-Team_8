```{r init, include=F}
data <- read.csv("Dataset.csv")
head(hospital_data)
```

1- How does the presence of diabetes mellitus correlate with age? Is diabetes a risk factor for hospital
death in older patients, and does age significantly impact the chance of developing diabetes?
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# Check the structure of the dataset
str(hospital_data)
correlation_age_diabetes <- cor(hospital_data$age, hospital_data$diabetes_mellitus)
cat("Correlation between Age and Diabetes Mellitus:", correlation_age_diabetes, "\n")
hospital_data <- hospital_data %>%
  mutate(age_group = ifelse(age >= 65, "Older", "Younger"))
cross_table <- table(hospital_data$diabetes_mellitus, hospital_data$age_group, hospital_data$hospital_death)
print(cross_table)
```

2- Are there any particular illnesses or risk factors (such as leukemia, cirrhosis, or diabetes mellitus) that
are closely linked to hospital deaths?

```{r}
selected_columns <- hospital_data %>%
  select(hospital_death, leukemia, cirrhosis, diabetes_mellitus)
model_leukemia <- glm(hospital_death ~ leukemia, data = selected_columns, family = "binomial")
model_cirrhosis <- glm(hospital_death ~ cirrhosis, data = selected_columns, family = "binomial")
model_diabetes <- glm(hospital_death ~ diabetes_mellitus, data = selected_columns, family = "binomial")

summary(model_leukemia)
summary(model_cirrhosis)
summary(model_diabetes)
```
3- Which underlying medical disorders account for the majority of hospital deaths among patients over the
age of 70? Are there any trends in the kinds of illnesses that cause death in this particular age range?
```{r}

older_patients <- hospital_data %>%
  filter(age_group == "Older")

selected_columns <- older_patients %>%
  select(hospital_death, leukemia, cirrhosis, diabetes_mellitus)  # Add more diseases as needed

death_counts <- colSums(selected_columns)

sorted_death_counts <- sort(death_counts, decreasing = TRUE)


print(sorted_death_counts)
```
4- What is the mortality rate in the dataset between patients under 65 and those above 65? Are the
causes of death for these age groups significantly different from one another?

```{r}
hospital_data <- hospital_data %>%
  mutate(age_group = ifelse(age < 65, "Under 65", "Above 65"))

contingency_table <- table(hospital_data$hospital_death, hospital_data$age_group)


chi_square_test <- chisq.test(contingency_table)
print(chi_square_test)


```
5- Which ICU types are most prevalent in the dataset, and does the type of ICU affect the risk of hospital
death?

```{r}

icu_type_counts <- table(hospital_data$icu_type)
print(icu_type_counts)

logistic_model <- glm(hospital_death ~ icu_type, data = hospital_data, family = "binomial")

summary(logistic_model)

```
6- What differences exist between patients who survive and those who do not in terms of the distribution
of "BMI" (body mass index)? Does a person's BMI have any bearing on hospital mortality?

```{r}
survived_bmi <- hospital_data$hospital_death == 0  # Assuming 0 represents survived patients
not_survived_bmi <- hospital_data$hospital_death == 1  # Assuming 1 represents not survived patients

summary(hospital_data$BMI[survived_bmi])  # Summary stats for survived patients' BMI
summary(hospital_data$BMI[not_survived_bmi])  # Summary stats for not survived patients' BMI

boxplot(bmi ~ hospital_death, data = hospital_data, xlab = "Hospital Mortality", ylab = "BMI")

t_test_result <- t.test(hospital_data$bmi[survived_bmi], hospital_data$BMI[not_survived_bmi])
print(t_test_result)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```
